 My Portfolio

 The purpose for this file is display my projects so far on website with all the skills ive learned to now.

 It has two pages, the main page then the contacts page.
 The emails real so if you want to get in touch try there, the timer is a little gimmick for the project.

So the page works by using the links on the left to go through out the page, the contacts takes you to the bottom of the page
where if you click on an email or phone number it will take you to the contacts page.

The licence is just the regular MIT one.
